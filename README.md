# My Environment Configuration (+ TMUX)

This repository has vim configuration that I like using (an atom dark theme for nvim), and other stuff such as packages installed (pathogen) and configuration for using TMUX. This will serve as a reminder and also, as a back-up in case I have to re-install everything from scratch (for instance formatting, new device, etc.)
